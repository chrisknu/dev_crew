# Technical Specifications Document

## 1. System Overview
The system is designed to be a modern web application utilizing Next.js 14, providing a user-friendly and responsive interface. The architecture focuses on scalability, maintainability, and performance.

## 2. Architecture Components

### 2.1 User Interface
- **Technology**: Next.js 14
- **Implementation Specifications**:
  - Use server-side rendering for pages that require SEO.
  - Create components using React functional components and hooks.
  - Utilize TailwindCSS for styling, adhering to the mobile-first approach.
  - Structure the application using Next.js folder conventions (pages, components, styles).

### 2.2 Authentication
- **Technology**: NextAuth.js
- **Implementation Specifications**:
  - Configure NextAuth.js through `[...nextauth].js` in the API route.
  - Implement OAuth providers for social login (e.g. Google, GitHub).
  - Create custom pages for authentication (sign in, sign out).
  - Utilize session management provided by NextAuth.js.

### 2.3 Backend
- **Technology**: Node.js and PostgreSQL with Prisma
- **Implementation Specifications**:
  - Set up PostgreSQL database using Docker for local development.
  - Define database schemas using Prisma schema files.
  - Create migration files to keep track of schema changes.
  - Use Prisma client for querying the database in service layers.

### 2.4 API Layer
- **Technology**: Next.js API Routes
- **Implementation Specifications**:
  - Create API routes under the `/api` directory for each resource (e.g. `/api/users`, `/api/posts`).
  - Implement RESTful methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations.
  - Implement middleware for authentication checks on protected routes.
  - Validate incoming requests using libraries such as `zod` or `joi`.

### 2.5 Deployment
- **Technology**: Vercel
- **Implementation Specifications**:
  - Use Vercel CLI to deploy the app directly from the development environment.
  - Configure environment variables for production settings.
  - Set up continuous integration/deployment using Vercel"s GitHub integration.

## 3. Security Considerations
- Enforce HTTPS in production.
- Use environment variables to manage sensitive data.
- Implement rate limiting and logging for API routes 

## 4. Testing Strategy
- **Frontend Testing**:
  - Utilize Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests.
  - Write end-to-end tests using Cypress.

- **Backend Testing**:
  - Implement integration tests for API routes using `supertest`.
  - Use Jest for unit testing service layers.

## 5. Roadmap Phases
- **Phase 1: User Authentication** - Set up NextAuth.js with estimated time of 2 weeks.
- **Phase 2: Database Integration** - Set up PostgreSQL with Prisma in 3 weeks.
- **Phase 3: Frontend Development** - Create user interfaces in 4 weeks.
- **Phase 4: API Development** - Develop RESTful API in 2 weeks.
- **Phase 5: Deployment and Testing** - Deploy on Vercel and conduct testing in 2 weeks.
