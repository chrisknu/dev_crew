# Project Plan for Modern Web Application

## Overview  
This project involves building a modern web application utilizing the following technologies:  
- **Next.js 15** with App Router  
- **Supabase** for authentication and database services  
- **PostgreSQL** with Drizzle ORM for data handling  
- **GraphQL API** along with REST where suitable  
- **TailwindCSS** with shadcn/ui components for styling  
- **TypeScript** for type safety  
- **CI/CD Pipeline** for deployment  
- **Server Components** using Edge Runtime where applicable
