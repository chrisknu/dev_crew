# Technical Specifications Document

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the technical specifications for the project based on the high-level system architecture considerations provided. The main components include Next.js 14 with App Router, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.

## 2. Purpose and Scope
This document aims to define the technical requirements, functional specifications, and design principles necessary to ensure the successful deployment and operation of the software.

## 3. Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

## 4. Architectural Design Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module should maintain its own functionality and purpose without overlap.
- **Scalability**: The system should allow for easy scaling as user demand increases.
- **Security**: Implement best security practices to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Modularity**: Design the application in a way that individual components can be independently developed and maintained.

## 5. Development Best Practices
- **Consistent Use of TypeScript**: Ensure that TypeScript is used throughout the development process for type safety and maintainability.
- **RESTful API Design**: Follow REST principles to create APIs that are easy to consume and maintain.

## 6. Testing Strategies
- **Unit Testing**: Each component should be unit tested to verify its correctness.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the integration between components to ensure they function together as expected.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Verify the entire application flow works as intended for the end user.

## 7. CI/CD Pipeline
- **Version Control**: Utilize Git for version control.
- **Automated Testing**: Set up automated tests to run upon changes to the codebase.
- **Deployment Strategy**: Clearly define deployment procedures to streamline the release process.

## 8. Monitoring/Logging Solutions
Implement logging to capture system events and errors, along with performance monitoring to ensure the system operates efficiently.
