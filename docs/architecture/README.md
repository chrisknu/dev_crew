# Architecture Overview

This document describes the architecture of the DevCrew project.

## System Components

### 1. Core Components

```
src/dev_crew/
├── crew.py       - Main crew orchestration
├── main.py       - Application entry point
└── config/       - Configuration management
```

### 2. Agent System

The project uses crewAI's agent system with the following architecture:

```
Crew (Orchestrator)
├── Agents
│   ├── Senior React Engineer
│   ├── Content Editor
│   └── Custom Agents...
└── Tasks
    ├── Analysis Tasks
    ├── Development Tasks
    └── Review Tasks
```

## Workflow

1. **Initialization**

   - Load configuration from YAML files
   - Initialize agents with specified roles
   - Set up tools and capabilities

2. **Task Execution**

   - Tasks are executed based on dependencies
   - Agents collaborate through crewAI's delegation system
   - Results are stored in the output directory

3. **Output Generation**
   - Final results are compiled
   - Reports are generated in markdown format
   - Artifacts are saved to the output directory

## Integration Points

- **OpenAI API**: Used for agent intelligence
- **Custom Tools**: Integrated through the tools directory
- **Configuration**: YAML-based configuration system
- **Output Management**: Structured output handling

## Best Practices

1. **Code Organization**

   - Keep agent definitions clean and focused
   - Separate configuration from logic
   - Use proper error handling

2. **Tool Integration**

   - Create reusable tools
   - Document tool capabilities
   - Handle tool failures gracefully

3. **Testing**
   - Unit test individual components
   - Integration test agent interactions
   - Test configuration loading

## Security Considerations

1. **API Keys**

   - Store in `.env` file
   - Never commit sensitive data
   - Use environment variables

2. **Access Control**
   - Limit agent capabilities appropriately
   - Control tool access
   - Monitor resource usage

## Scaling Considerations

1. **Agent Management**

   - Design for multiple agent types
   - Consider resource limitations
   - Plan for concurrent operations

2. **Task Management**
   - Handle task dependencies
   - Implement proper error recovery
   - Consider task prioritization
