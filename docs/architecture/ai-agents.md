# AI Agents Architecture

## Agent System Overview

DevCrew's AI agent system is built on specialized agents, each with defined roles and responsibilities in the software development lifecycle.

    class Agent {
        +role: string
        +goal: string
        +backstory: string
        +tools: List[Tool]
        +execute_task()
        +delegate_task()
    }
    
    class ProjectManager {
        +analyze_requirements()
        +create_project_plan()
        +coordinate_tasks()
    }
    
    class Architect {
        +design_architecture()
        +make_technical_decisions()
        +review_implementation()
    }
    
    class SeniorEngineer {
        +implement_features()
        +manage_code_quality()
        +setup_framework()
    }
    
    class QAEngineer {
        +create_tests()
        +validate_implementation()
        +ensure_quality()
    }
    
    class TechnicalWriter {
        +create_documentation()
        +write_guides()
        +maintain_docs()
    }

## Agent Interaction Model

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant PM as Project Manager
    participant A as Architect
    participant SE as Senior Engineer
    participant QA as QA Engineer
    participant TW as Technical Writer
    
    PM->>A: Share Requirements
    A->>SE: Provide Technical Design
    SE->>QA: Submit Implementation
    QA->>SE: Report Issues
    SE->>A: Request Design Review
    A->>PM: Update Progress
    SE->>TW: Provide Implementation Details
    TW->>PM: Submit Documentation
```

## Agent Configuration

Each agent is configured with specific parameters:

```python
{
    "role": "Agent Role",
    "goal": "Primary Objective",
    "backstory": "Agent Background",
    "verbose": true,
    "allow_delegation": true,
    "tools": [
        "List of available tools"
    ]
}
```

## Agent Communication

Agents communicate through a structured message system:

```python
{
    "from_agent": "Sender Agent",
    "to_agent": "Receiver Agent",
    "message_type": "Type of message",
    "content": "Message content",
    "metadata": {
        "priority": "Priority level",
        "timestamp": "Message timestamp",
        "context": "Additional context"
    }
}
```

## Agent Decision Making

Agents follow a structured decision-making process:

1. **Input Analysis**
   - Context evaluation
   - Requirement analysis
   - Resource assessment

2. **Task Planning**
   - Step identification
   - Resource allocation
   - Timeline planning

3. **Execution**
   - Task implementation
   - Progress monitoring
   - Quality checks

4. **Review & Optimization**
   - Result validation
   - Performance analysis
   - Improvement identification

## Agent Learning & Improvement

While agents don't learn during runtime, they are designed to:

1. **Follow Best Practices**
   - Industry standards
   - Coding conventions
   - Documentation practices

2. **Use Patterns**
   - Design patterns
   - Implementation patterns
   - Testing patterns

3. **Optimize Processes**
   - Workflow improvements
   - Resource optimization
   - Quality enhancements

## Future Agent Enhancements

Planned improvements for the agent system:

1. **Enhanced Capabilities**
   - Better decision making
   - Improved coordination
   - Advanced problem solving

2. **Additional Roles**
   - DevOps specialist
