## Core Components

### 1. Task Orchestrator

The task orchestrator manages the workflow between different AI agents and ensures proper sequencing of development tasks:

- Requirements analysis
- Architecture design
- Implementation
- Testing
- Documentation

### 2. AI Agents System

Each agent is specialized for specific tasks in the development lifecycle:

- **Project Manager**: Coordinates activities and manages requirements
- **Architect**: Designs system architecture and makes technical decisions
- **Senior Engineer**: Implements core functionality and manages code
- **QA Engineer**: Handles testing and quality assurance
- **Technical Writer**: Creates and maintains documentation

### 3. Tools Integration

DevCrew integrates various tools to support development:

- SerperDev for research and information gathering
- File system management for project organization
- Shell command execution for development tasks
- Framework-specific tools for project setup
