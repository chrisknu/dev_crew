### Project Plan for Modern Web Application

#### Overview
We are building a modern web application utilizing:
- **Framework:** Next.js 15
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **API:** GraphQL with REST fallback
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS
- **Type Checking:** TypeScript with strict type checking
- **Testing:** Unit and integration tests
- **CI/CD:** Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline
- **Rendering Model:** Server Components as the default, Edge Runtime where possible

### Task Breakdown with Time Estimates

1. **Project Setup (10 hours)**
   - Set up Next.js environment
   - Initialize project with TypeScript
   - Install necessary dependencies (Supabase, Drizzle ORM, GraphQL libraries)
   - Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality

2. **Database Design (12 hours)**
   - Define data models using Drizzle ORM
   - Set up PostgreSQL database on Supabase
   - Create necessary migrations to reflect data models

3. **Authentication Implementation (15 hours)**
   - Set up Supabase Auth for user registration and login
   - Configure session management and token storage

4. **GraphQL API Development (20 hours)**
   - Design GraphQL schema
   - Implement resolvers and connect to Drizzle ORM for data fetching
   - Implement REST fallback for legacy support

5. **Frontend Development (30 hours)**
   - Create layout components using TailwindCSS
   - Implement pages: authentication pages, dashboard, and user management
   - Integrate APIs to fetch data and update UI accordingly

6. **Edge Runtime Configuration (5 hours)**
   - Configure necessary Next.js settings to utilize Edge Runtime effectively

7. **Testing (20 hours)**
   - Write unit tests for components and functions
   - Write integration tests for API endpoints
   - Set up testing framework (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library)

8. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup (15 hours)**
   - Configure GitHub Actions or another CI/CD tool
   - Set up build, test, and deploy processes

9. **Documentation and Cleanup (5 hours)**
   - Document API endpoints, architecture decisions, and setup instructions
   - Clean up codebase and remove unused files

10. **Review and Deployment (5 hours)**
    - Conduct code reviews
    - Deploy application to Vercel or preferred hosting service
