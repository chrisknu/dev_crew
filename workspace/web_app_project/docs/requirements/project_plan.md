Project Plan for Modern Web Application

Overview:
The project involves the development of a modern web application using the following technologies and features:
- Next.js 15 with App Router using server-first approach
- Authentication via Supabase Auth
- PostgreSQL database utilizing Supabase and Drizzle ORM for models and migrations
- GraphQL API with REST fallback
- TailwindCSS for styling with shadcn/ui components
