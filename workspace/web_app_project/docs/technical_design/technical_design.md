# Technical Design Document

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the technical design for the web application project, detailing the component implementation specifications, development standards, and technical requirements.

## 2. Component Implementation Specifications
### 2.1 Frontend Hierarchy
- **Structure**: The frontend will consist of a modular design with components structured as follows:
  - App
    - Pages
    - Components
    - Utilities

### 2.2 API Specifications
- **Base URL**: `/api`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /users` - Retrieves a list of users.
  - `POST /users` - Creates a new user.

### 2.3 Database Schema
- **Users Table**:
  - id: int, primary key
  - name: string
  - email: string, unique

### 2.4 Authentication Details
- **Method**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **End-Point**: `/auth/login` for user authentication

### 2.5 Service Integrations
- **Third-Party Services**: Integration with payment gateways like Stripe for processing transactions.

## 3. Development Standards
### 3.1 Coding Conventions
- Follow ESLint and Prettier guidelines for code style consistency.

### 3.2 Testing Requirements
- Unit tests with Jest and integration tests with React Testing Library.

### 3.3 Documentation Standards
- All components and utilities must be documented using JSDoc.

### 3.4 Error Handling Patterns
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations and centralize error handling logic.

### 3.5 Logging Standards
- Utilize a structured logging library such as Winston for error logging.

## 4. Technical Requirements
### 4.1 Development Environment Setup
- **Node.js** version 14+ and npm installed.

### 4.2 Dependencies
- List of dependencies:
  - React
  - Express
  - Mongoose

### 4.3 Build and Deployment Procedures
- Use Webpack for bundling resources and Docker for containerization.

### 4.4 Testing Framework Configuration
- Setup Jest as the testing framework.

### 4.5 CI/CD Pipeline Specifications
- Use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.

## 5. Conclusion
This technical design document serves as a guideline to implement the specified functionality and standards throughout the development of the web application.
