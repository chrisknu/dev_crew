# System Architecture Document

## 1. System Overview  
The proposed system is a modern web application intended to serve a diverse range of users with various functionalities centered around user engagement and data management. The application will utilize a responsive design, ensuring compatibility across desktop and mobile devices, leveraging best practices for user experience and performance.

## 2. Technology Stack  
- **Frontend:**  
  - Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation  
  - TailwindCSS for styling and rapid UI development

- **Backend:**  
  - Supabase for real-time database management, providing authentication and storage capabilities.
  - PostgreSQL as the database to handle complex queries and data integrity.
  - GraphQL to provide a flexible and efficient way to query data.

### Justification for Technology Choices  
1. **Next.js**: Chosen for its efficient rendering capabilities, optimized performance, and SEO-friendly structure.
2. **Supabase**: Selected for its ease of use and rapid integration for authentication and database management.
3. **PostgreSQL**: Provides powerful features such as ACID compliance and supports complex query requirements.
4. **GraphQL**: Allows clients to request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching and improving performance.

### Version Requirements and Compatibility  
- Next.js v15  
- Supabase version compatible with PostgreSQL v14  
- Ensure that libraries used for GraphQL are up-to-date with the latest specifications for REST integration.

### Alternatives Considered  
- **Firebase**: Considered for its simplicity but discarded due to vendor lock-in concerns. 
- **Redux**: Evaluated for state management but chose to use React's built-in context API to maintain simplicity.

## 3. Component Architecture  
The system will consist of several key components, each interacting with one another:
- **Frontend (Next.js):**  
  - Pages: Home, Profile, Dashboard, etc.  
  - Components: Reusable UI components with TailwindCSS styles.  
  - API calls to the backend to fetch or manipulate data via GraphQL queries.

- **Backend (Supabase & PostgreSQL):**  
  - Authentication module: Manages user sign-up, login, and session storage.  
  - Database schema: Designed to optimize queries and ensure data integrity.  
  - REST/GraphQL API: Interfaces that fulfill frontend requests.

    A[Frontend (Next.js)] -->|API Calls| B[Backend (Supabase)]
    B -->|Data Queries| C[Database (PostgreSQL)]
    A -->|User Actions| D[Authentication]
    D -->|User Data| C
```

## 4. Data Flow  
Data will flow in a bidirectional manner between components:  
1. User actions trigger API calls from the frontend to the backend.  
2. The backend processes the request and returns data in JSON format via GraphQL.  
3. The frontend updates the UI based on the received data.  
4. For real-time updates, a WebSocket connection will be established through Supabase for data synchronization.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements  
- **Performance:** The application must load within 2 seconds on standard broadband connections.
- **Scalability:** The application must support up to 10,000 concurrent users.
- **Security:** Implement OAuth 2.0 via Supabase for secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Maintainability:** Follow best coding practices and maintain clear documentation to facilitate future development.

### Security Measures  
- Use HTTPS for all connections.
- Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent XSS and SQL injection attacks.
- Regularly update dependencies to address vulnerabilities.

## 6. Infrastructure  
The application will be hosted on a cloud provider for scalability and availability.  
- **Hosting:** Vercel for frontend hosting (optimized for Next.js).
- **Database:** Supabase will handle the PostgreSQL database deployment and management.

    B -->|API Calls| C[Supabase (Backend)];
    C -->|SQL Queries| D[PostgreSQL Database];
```

## Conclusion  
This document presents a comprehensive architecture for developing a modern web application using Next.js, Supabase, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, and TailwindCSS by adhering to best practices to ensure the application is robust, scalable, and secure.
